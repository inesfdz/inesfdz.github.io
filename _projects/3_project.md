## Project desc

PCBs are toxic coumpounds found in the environment. Our study focuses on how human gut microbiota can account for the observed toxicity. We also aimed at assessing the effectiveness of a prebiotic treatment based on the consumption of an anthocyanin-rich potato cultivar. We used a gut model to simulate in vitro digestion. We tried to show the presence of hydrogene sulfide, a microbial metabolite linked to dysbiosis, which could partially account for the coumpound toxicity. We also measured increased antioxidant capacity after the prebiotic treatment, demonstrating the relevance of such therapeutic options.

## Techniques used 

Gut simulator, various biological assays (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power Assay _aka_ FRAP assay, H2S quantification)
