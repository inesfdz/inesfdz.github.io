## Project desc

Course project (1 year) under the supervision of [Alexandre Kempf](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZZw5eWoAAAAJ&hl=en)

We characterized the neural coding in the auditory cortex of mice by selecting different sound profiles, allowing us to visualize the influence of the frequency and the intensity of the sound in auditory perception. We focused on direct correlation between neural activity intensity and sound intensity, as well as clusters of neurons that respond specifically to certain ranges of frequency.

## Techniques used 

2-photon-microscopy, image analysis (Python)
