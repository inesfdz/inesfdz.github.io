## Project desc

Course project (3 months) under the supervision of [Marie-Paule Cani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Paule_Cani) (professor at College de France)

The objective was to develop an expressive 3D modeler (fast and intuitive to use), under WebGL which makes it available directly on the web, and to use it to design and manufacture a prototype object. The modeler was dedicated to the design of imaginary flying machines, such as those dreamed by Leonardo da Vinci or by Jules Verne. Finally, the chosen machine was manufactured in the schoolâ€™s FabLab (by 3D printing, laser cutting, or a combination of both), and animated virtually, to illustrate its imaginary functioning.

## Techniques used 

WebGL, Fablab design
