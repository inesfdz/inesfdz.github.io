Project desc : We studied the growth in the yeast S. pombe by combining genetic engineering to prepare the strains to be studied, video-microscopy to image them in vivo, image analysis to quantify the acquired data and modeling to confront them with a quantitative model

Techniques used : genetic engineering, video-microscopy, image analysis (Python)
