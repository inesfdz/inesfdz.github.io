## Project desc

Course project (3 months) under the supervision of [Anatole Chessel](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/lob/en/anatole-chessel)

We studied the growth in the yeast _S. pombe_ by combining genetic engineering to prepare the strains to be studied, video-microscopy to image them in vivo, image analysis to quantify the acquired data and modeling to confront them with a quantitative model.

## Techniques used 

Genetic engineering, video-microscopy, image analysis (Python)
